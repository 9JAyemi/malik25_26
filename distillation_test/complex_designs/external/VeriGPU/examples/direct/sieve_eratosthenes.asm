; sieve of eratosthenes, for prime numbers up to 31
; in this version, since we can currenlty only write words, we
; are going to use an entire word to mark a prime or not

; first we have to initialize the memory
; then run the sieve
; then write out the results

li x2, 31   ; max prime

; initialize memory

    add x5, x1, x5
    sw x4, 0, x5
    addi x3, x3, 1
